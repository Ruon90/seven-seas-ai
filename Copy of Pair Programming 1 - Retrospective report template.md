**User Story Status**

* Fulfilled the requirements of the user story, with comprehensive details and easy to access calls to action.  
* All user story requirements were met

**What has been achieved**

* Created a services page  
* Used images to make it easier to identify services  
* Made the page responsive to all screen sizes  
* CTA to contact  
* Created the site almost entirely using AI  
* Full site passed validation

**Areas for improvement**

* I used GITHUB chat to do 95% of all tasks to test prompting, this was definitely not the best use case but i gained valuable insight into using ai tools for coding.

**Lessons learned** 

* AI coding is quite sloppy and uses a lot of \!important markers  
* AI coding can be slow for a lot of tasks in comparison to just using emmet to code.  
* Larger workload could benefit from using AI to do repetitive simple tasks  
* Explanations need to be as clear as possible for prompts
